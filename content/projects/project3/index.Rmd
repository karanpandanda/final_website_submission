## My forecast of what is coming!

America is in a state of political, economic and social turmoil. And the election still hasn't happened yet! This page looks at Donald Trump's approval amongst his voters and how it has changed since Biden has become the confirmed Democratic candidate. Biden is ahead in the polls as of today so are we in for a new President? The race is on. Four years after Trump's historic election victory, the time has come again this November - the 52 American states will elect a new president. As of today, Biden is far ahead in the polls. If you want some more in-depth analysis, you can find some more data [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/).

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
# Import approval polls data
# approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

In the graph below, we can see the progression of Trump's net approval across every single week in his presidency. The results might surprise you!

```{r}
approval_data <- approval_polllist %>% 
  #filter(subgroup=="All polls", tracking=="TRUE") %>% 
  mutate(year = year(mdy(enddate)), week = week(mdy(enddate)),     
          net_approval=(approve-disapprove)) 

data_summary <- approval_data %>%  
  group_by(year, week) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(), avg_net_approval=mean(net_approval),sd=sd(net_approval),
            se=sd/sqrt(count), 
            t_critical=qt(0.975,count-1), 
            lower_CI=avg_net_approval-t_critical*se, upper_CI=avg_net_approval+t_critical*se)

data_summary %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=week, y=avg_net_approval,color=factor(year),fill=factor(year)))+
  geom_point()+geom_line()+ geom_hline(yintercept=0, color = "orange")+ 
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower_CI, ymax=upper_CI), alpha=0.1)+
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw()+theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold")) +
  labs (title = "Does America really approve of Trump?",
      subtitle = "Average Weekly Net Approval Margins of polls",
    y = "Average Net Approval(%)",
    x = "Week of the year"
  )  + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,52,by= 13))+scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-20,7.5,by= 2.5))+
  guides(fill=F, color=F)+
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0), color="orange")+
  theme(aspect.ratio=0.5)
```

Trump hasn't had a positive net approval since he entered office in early 2017! How much of a reflection is this on the current state of the USA? What are the reasons behind this; besides his boisterous attitude, his non-presidential like demeanour and his general body-language? Trump has had a very up & down presidency, as can be seen by the numerous up and down shifts in each of the four graphs above; is this the sign of a good president and leader? Personally, I think Trump has a knack for coming across as a champion of the downtrodden, but I don't think that necessarily translates into good leadership abilities.
```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%",include=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Next we want to compare the confidence intervals.

```{r compare_two_weeks,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
data_summary %>% 
  filter(year==2020,week %in% c(15,34)) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()

```
From the two-row table above, we can clearly see that the Trumpâ€™s net approval rate has fallen approximately 4 percents to -11.5% within 19 weeks and its corresponding confidence intervals widened, too. It indicates voters were becoming more wavering and many of them transferred to Biden, especially after the Democratic National Convention held in 18 August.

## Conclusion

So what is the data above telling us? It is telling us that Trump's days in office are numbered as people have steadily reduced their confidence in his ability to lead the country. This is potentially because Biden has a more moderate approach to politics than Trump and after 4 years of the Donald, I think everyone has had enough!

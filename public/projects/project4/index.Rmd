## Introduction

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11).

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).

In the following case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. First, we will use the `tidyquant` package to download monthly rates for different durations. 

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,var=myvars, maturity=maturity)
# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)
```

```{r}
glimpse(mylookup)
```

The dataframe `df` has three columns (variables):

- `symbol`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `date`: already a date object
- `price`: the actual yield on that date

The first thing would be to join this dataframe `df` with the dataframe `mylookup` so that we have a more readable version of maturities, durations, etc.


```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 
```

## Plotting the yield curve

In the following graphs, I will show a comprehensive overview of yields on US rates over different time frames.

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r}
yield_curve$var_f = factor(yield_curve$var, levels=c('3-Month Treasury Bill', '6-Month Treasury Bill', '1-Year Treasury Rate', '2-Year Treasury Rate','3-Year Treasury Rate','5-Year Treasury Rate','7-Year Treasury Rate','10-Year Treasury Rate','20-Year Treasury Rate','30-Year Treasury Rate'))

yield_curve %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=price, color=symbol))+
  facet_wrap(~var_f,ncol = 2)+
  geom_line()+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title="Yield on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960", x="", y="%")
```

Based on the graphs, we can observe, that the yields for the US treasury bills with different maturities have been very similar since the year 1960. But what about the others?

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

```{r}
year <- yield_curve %>%
  mutate(year = year(ymd(date))) %>%
  filter(year > 1998) %>%
  mutate(month = month(ymd(date)))

ggplot(year, aes(x=maturity, y=price))+
  facet_wrap(~year,ncol = 4)+
  geom_line(aes(group = month, color=factor(year)))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title="U.S. Yield Curve", x="Maturity", y="Yield (%)")
```

The above graph that sums up the data on a year-by-year basis, clearly underlines that the yields have decreased a lot since 1999. This as a direct opposite to the one before, that showed a rather stable trend of the data.

### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r}
year_v2 <- yield_curve %>%
  mutate(year = year(ymd(date))) %>%
  filter(year > 1998) %>%
  filter(var_f %in% c("3-Month Treasury Bill","10-Year Treasury Rate")) %>%
  mutate(month = month(ymd(date)))

ggplot(year_v2, aes(x=date, y=price))+
  geom_line(aes(color=var_f))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "right", legend.title = element_blank())+
  labs(title="Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999", x="", y="%")
```

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?

Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things I now need to do to produce the final plot on these data.

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)

For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946:

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions
```

```{r}
library(scales)

A <- yield_curve %>% 
  filter(maturity %in% c("3m","10y")) %>% 
  mutate(year=year(ymd(date))) %>% 
  mutate(date=ymd(date)) %>% 
  arrange(date) %>% 
  select(-var,-symbol,-var_f) %>% 
  mutate(
    maturity=case_when(
      maturity=="3m" ~ "three_month",
      maturity=="10y" ~"ten_year"
    )
  ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "maturity",values_from = "price")

B <- recessions %>% 
  select(from, to, duration_days) %>% 
  mutate(year=year(ymd(from)))

data <- left_join(A,B,by="year") %>% 
  mutate(diff = ten_year-three_month) %>% 
  mutate(
         # excess_rent = actual_rent - expected_rent, 
         # excess_rent_per = (excess_rent + expected_rent)/expected_rent-1,
         plus_per = ifelse(diff>0, diff, 0), 
         minus_per = ifelse(diff < 0, diff, 0)
         )

ggplot(data, aes(x=date, y=diff), fill="blue")+
  geom_line()+
  geom_line(y=0, color="black")+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=minus_per),fill="red",alpha=0.6)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=plus_per),fill="lightblue",alpha=0.6)+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=ymd(from), xmax=ymd(to), ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf), fill='darkgray', alpha=0.05)+
  theme_minimal()+
  geom_rug(aes(colour=ifelse(diff>=0,">=0","<0")),sides="b")+
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("red","lightblue"), guide=FALSE)+
  scale_x_date(
    limits = c(as.Date("1960-01-01",  "%Y-%m-%d"), as.Date("2020-12-20",  "%Y-%m-%d")),
    breaks = date_breaks("2 year"),
    labels = date_format("%Y"))+
  labs(title = "Yield Curve Inversion: 10-year minus 3-month U.S. Treasury rates", 
       subtitle = "Difference in % points, monthly averages.\nShaded areas correspond to recessions",
       x="",
       y="Difference (10-year minus 3-month) yield in %",
       caption = "Source: FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis")+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size=6), 
        axis.title = element_text(size=8), 
        plot.title = element_text(size=10,face="bold"), 
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size=6))
```

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, we found out that the spread in yield between the 10-year and 3-year treasury turns negative before the economic crisis. This could be an indicator to predict future recession. However, there have been some occasions where the inversion did not lead to a recession immediately (c. 1967). Besides that, there has been a recession without a prior inversion of the yield curve as in the year of 1991. Therefore, I can conclude that the inversion of the yield curve can be used as one factor in such analysis, but we have to keep in mind different other variables as well. This would allow for a more valid and reliable conclusion on the data.

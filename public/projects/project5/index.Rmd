# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

We explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. The confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will reproduce the graph above.

In addition, we will run a hypothesis test, using use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, assuming zero difference between the two.

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

```{r}

Directors_F <- movies %>%
      filter(director =="Steven Spielberg"|director=="Tim Burton")

obs_diff_imdb <- Directors_F %>%
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

null_dist_imdb <- Directors_F %>%
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

null_dist_imdb %>% 
  visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_imdb, direction = "two-sided")+
  labs(title="Simulation Based Null Distribution")+
  theme_bw()

```
```{r}

null_dist_imdb %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_imdb, direction = "two_sided")


```


```{r}

null_dist_imdb  %>%
  get_confidence_interval(point_estimate = obs_diff_imdb, level = .95,type = "se")

```

```{r}

CI_Directors <- Directors_F %>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(Mean=mean(rating), SE=sd(rating)/sqrt(n()), T.critical = qt(0.975,n()-1),Upper_CI = Mean+SE*T.critical, Lower_CI = Mean-SE*T.critical)


ggplot(CI_Directors, aes(x=Mean, y=reorder(director, Mean)))+
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin=Lower_CI, xmax=Upper_CI, width=0.2, color=director, size=1.6))+
  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same IMDB ratings?",
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap",
       x = "Mean IMBD Rating",
       y = "") +
  geom_point(aes(color=director, size=2))+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=max(Lower_CI), xmax=min(Upper_CI),ymin=-Inf, ymax=+Inf))+
  geom_label(aes(y=reorder(director,Mean),x=Lower_CI,
                label = round(Lower_CI,2)),
                hjust=0.4, vjust=-0.3,
                fill=NA, label.size = NA) +
   geom_label(aes(y=reorder(director,Mean),x=Upper_CI,
                   label = round(Upper_CI,2)),
                hjust=0.4, vjust=-0.3,
                fill=NA, label.size = NA)+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(Mean,2),vjust=-1.5))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "null")
  

```

Conclusion: the confidence intervals of the 2 groups overlap, we could think that the difference between the groups is not statistically significant. However, it does not tell the whole story. The results also shows a p value of 0.014, we can reject the null hypothesis. P value usually varies between 0 and 1, with a p value less than 0.05, in this case it is 0.014, so there is 1.4% probability the null is correct.The p value is statistically significant. Therefore, despite the overlapping, the difference between these 2 means is statistically significant.
